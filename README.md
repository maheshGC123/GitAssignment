IOS Architecture

IOS is a Mobile Operating System that was developed by Apple Inc. for iPhones, iPads, and other Apple mobile devices. iOS is the second most popular and most used Mobile Operating System after Android.

The structure of the iOS operating System is Layered based. Its communication doesn’t occur directly. The layer’s between the Application Layer and the Hardware layer will help for Communication. The lower level gives basic services on which all applications rely and the higher-level layers provide graphics and interface-related services. Most of the system interfaces come with a special package called a framework.

A framework is a directory that holds dynamic shared libraries like .a files, header files, images, and helper apps that support the library. Each layer has a set of frameworks that are helpful for developers.
