Native Applications
Native App Development is one of the most used platforms by developers due to its vast user friendly features.
Applications developed to be used on a particular platform or operating system such as Android, iOS etc. Native apps are usually written in languages that the platform accepts. They are also built using the specific Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the given operating systems, such as Android Studio for Android Apps and XCode for iOS Apps.
